### **Project Title:**

**Agno Multi-Agent Financial Report Generator**

### **Objective**

The system automates end-to-end financial report generation from heterogeneous data sources (CSVs, PDFs, and DOCX files). It leverages the **Agno multi-agent orchestration framework** with OpenAI’s `gpt-4o` model to perform data extraction, statistical summarization, risk assessment, and strategy formulation.

The goal is to unify raw financial data into structured insights, producing a complete multi-layered report combining quantitative analytics with LLM-based qualitative reasoning.

### **1. Methodological Overview**

The methodology integrates **three core agents**, each trained for a distinct analytical layer:

1. **DataAssistantAgent** — handles ingestion, normalization, and descriptive analytics.
2. **RiskAssessorAgent** — evaluates the dataset’s numerical volatility and produces a structured risk profile.
3. **MarketStrategistAgent** — synthesizes all prior outputs to generate actionable market strategies and financial recommendations.

Each agent acts as a semi-autonomous worker, exchanging contextual insights through shared state objects coordinated by Agno’s `Agent` class.

### **2. Data Handling Flow**

1. **File Ingestion**

   * Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, `.docx`
   * Each file is read and converted into a **Pandas DataFrame** via helper utilities (`_extract_pdf`, `_extract_docx`, `read_file_to_df`).
   * All dataframes are concatenated into a unified dataset.

2. **Preprocessing & Normalization**

   * Columns are auto-aligned by header matching.
   * Numeric and categorical data are separated.
   * Statistical summaries (`mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`) are computed for validation.

3. **Agent Coordination via Agno**

   * Agno serves as the **conversation orchestrator**, maintaining consistent context between agents.
   * Each agent’s `run()` method returns a structured dictionary (data, comments, and LLM narrative).
   * Context flows sequentially:

     ```
     DataAssistantAgent → RiskAssessorAgent → MarketStrategistAgent
     ```
   * Results are merged into a final composite data dictionary.

4. **Report Synthesis**

   * The aggregated output is rendered into a **PDF report** (`BeautifulFinancialPDF` class) using tabular visualization for numeric summaries and section-based formatting for narratives.
   * Sections include:

     * Data Processing Summary
     * Key Financial Indicators
     * Risk Evaluation
     * Market Strategy
     * AI-Generated Commentary

### **3. Agent Design & Responsibilities**

**(a) DataAssistantAgent**

* Reads and merges financial datasets.
* Detects anomalies and statistical irregularities.
* Requests LLM interpretation to summarize structural and numerical patterns.

**(b) RiskAssessorAgent**

* Computes simple quantitative risk metrics (volatility via Coefficient of Variation).
* Prompts LLM for domain-specific risk narrative (liquidity, credit, market).
* Outputs structured risk score and textual insights.

**(c) MarketStrategistAgent**

* Consumes risk and data summaries to produce strategic recommendations.
* Identifies actionable investment steps, allocations, and monitoring KPIs.
* Produces the final “Market Strategy Narrative.”

### **4. Role of Agno in Coordination**

Agno acts as the **multi-agent middleware**, simplifying:

* Parallel or sequential agent orchestration
* Context propagation between models
* Controlled prompt execution with traceable outputs

Each agent is instantiated with:

```python
self.agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o", api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY),
    description="Specialized financial reasoning agent",
    markdown=False
)
```

This abstraction allows for dynamic role assignment, transparent execution, and deterministic logging of intermediate agent states.

---

### **5. Data Security and Compliance**

* No data is transmitted outside the local environment except through secure OpenAI API calls.
* Temporary dataframes are discarded after report generation.
* Sensitive information (e.g., keys) is handled through environment variables via `config.py` and `.env` files.

---

### **6. Output and Visualization**

Final outputs include:

* A **composite DataFrame summary** (tabulated statistics).
* A **professionally formatted PDF report**, with:

  * Hierarchical headings
  * Clear tabular numeric summaries
  * Risk-to-strategy narrative linkage
  * “Generated by Agno Multi-Agent Framework” signature

---

### **7. Limitations and Future Scope**

* Current pipeline processes static datasets; dynamic time-series modeling is under development.
* Integration with SQL backends or cloud-native stores (Azure, AWS) can extend scalability.
* Planned future agents include:

  * **AuditAgent:** detects accounting inconsistencies.
  * **ForecastAgent:** uses ARIMA/LSTM models for predictive analytics.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

The system demonstrates a modular, agent-oriented approach to financial intelligence automation.
By combining quantitative computation with LLM-based reasoning through Agno, it achieves hybrid interpretability — where structured metrics and narrative insights co-evolve to create explainable financial reporting pipelines.
